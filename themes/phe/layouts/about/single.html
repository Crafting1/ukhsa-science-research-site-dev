                <p>Our Research Strategy outlines how PHE uses research, translation and innovation to support the
                    transformation of public health practice and services.</p>

                <p>This strategy outlines PHE plans, actions and measures of success for research on public and
                    population health and health protection. It outlines our commitment to working in partnership with
                    academics, research funders, the NHS and the public.</p>

                <p>We foster, encourage and enable research to address priority questions for public health, align
                    research capacity to priorities and support the translation of findings into innovations in
                    practices and services.</p>
