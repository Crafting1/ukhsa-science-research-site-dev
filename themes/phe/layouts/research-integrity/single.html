                <p>PHE recognises and endorses the Concordat to Support Research Integrity as published by Universities
                    UK, and is committed to maintaining the highest standards of integrity in all aspects of research.
                </p>

                <p>Scientific integrity is essential for the conduct and planning of research, the recording and
                    reporting of results, and the publication of findings. All PHE researchers are required to undertake
                    their work with honesty, rigour, transparency and care for the subjects of their research. These
                    values are central to a healthy research culture and ensure high quality research with results that
                    can be trusted</p>

                <p>We support the principles of open access and open science, because we recognise the benefits they can
                    bring to public health.</p>

                <p>These benefits include the ability to rapidly disseminate and provide a global equity of access to
                    the outputs of research, which can aid evidence-based public health policy and practice, and the
                    development of new research.</p>

                <p>To support these principles we have created an open access policy and have implemented an
                    institutional repository, where the peer-reviewed outputs of research can be made open access for
                    the benefit of public health and society.</p>
