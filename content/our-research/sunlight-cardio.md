<p>We should all be aware of the hazards of staying out too long in the sun â€“ sunburn, increasing risk of skin cancer, skin ageing, to name a few. However, recent work from UKHSA and others shows that some sunlight exposure may be beneficial for our cardiovascular health. High blood pressure affects around 25&percnt; of UK adults and is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease; therefore, strategies to alleviate this burden of disease are a key priority.</p>

<p>Nitric oxide is a small molecule that is released in the skin by ultraviolet light (present in sunlight) and acts to expand the blood vessels in the body. This lowers blood pressure, thus reducing the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The exact size of effect sunlight could have on cardiovascular health by this mechanism is unknown, however early clinical trials, epidemiological and laboratory data are supportive of this protective mechanism.</p>
<p>Indeed, recently published work by researchers at UKHSA has shown that low exposures to natural sunlight (around 10 minutes on a clear summer day) can induce this effect in cells. Importantly, these doses of sunlight produced no detrimental effects to the cells. It may be possible then to be protected against the harmful effects of sunlight while taking advantage of the benefits to our health that sunlight has to offer, though further work is needed to study these effects in humans. Research on this area continues under the <a href="https://crth.hpru.nihr.ac.uk/" target="_blank" >NIHR Chemical Radiation Threats and Hazards Health Protection Research Unit</a>, and in collaboration with partner universities.</p>
